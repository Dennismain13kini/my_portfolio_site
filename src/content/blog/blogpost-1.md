### Title: Analyzing and Forecasting Time Series Data with R

---

### Introduction

In this project breakdown, we'll delve into various techniques for analyzing and forecasting time series data using R. We'll cover data generation, conversion to time series objects, plotting, seasonal decomposition, handling irregular time series, outlier detection, stationarity tests, autocorrelation, and ARIMA modeling. By the end of this post, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to work with time series data in R.

### Explanation of the Code

#### Generating Random Data

First, let's generate random data using normal and uniform distributions.

```r
# Generate 10 random values from a normal distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 3
x <- rnorm(10, 5, 3)
x

# Generate 10 random values from a uniform distribution between 20 and 50
y <- runif(10, 20, 50)
y
```

These functions help in generating sample data which can be useful for testing and simulations.

#### Working with Time Series Data

Next, we generate a dataset and convert it into a time series object.

```r
# Generate 50 random values from a uniform distribution between 10 and 45
mydata <- runif(n=50, min=10, max=45)
str(mydata)

# Convert the data into a time series object starting from 1956 with quarterly frequency
myts <- ts(data=mydata, start=1956, frequency=4)
myts
class(myts)

# Show the time series
time(myts)

# Plot the time series
par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))
par(oma=c(1,1,1,1))
plot(myts)
```

We start by creating a uniformly distributed random dataset and converting it into a time series object with a specific start year and frequency. This object is then plotted to visualize the data.

#### Seasonal Decomposition and Forecasting

We use a built-in dataset for further analysis.

```r
# Plotting the 'nottem' dataset: Average Monthly Temperatures at Nottingham, 1920-1939
plot(nottem)

# Seasonal decomposition of the 'nottem' time series
plot(decompose(nottem))

# Forecasting using ARIMA model
install.packages('forecast')
library(forecast)
plot(forecast(auto.arima(nottem), h=5)) # Forecast for the next 5 years
```

We decompose the time series to understand its seasonal patterns and then forecast future values using the ARIMA model.

#### Handling Irregular Time Series

Irregular time series data can be managed using the `zoo` package.

```r
# Install and load the zoo package
install.packages('zoo')
library(zoo)

# Import sensor dataset and split date and time
library(tidyverse)
irregular_sensor <- read.csv("sensor_data.csv")
irreg.split <- separate(irregular_sensor, col='V1', into=c('date', 'time'), sep=8, remove=T)

# Convert date to Date object
sensor.date <- strptime(irreg.split$date, '%m/%d/%y')
irregts.df <- data.frame(date=as.Date(sensor.date), measurements=irreg.split$V2)

# Create zoo object and aggregate data
irreg.dates <- zoo(irregts.df$measurements, order.by=irregts.df$date)
ag.irregtime <- aggregate(irreg.dates, as.Date, mean)
plot(ag.irregtime)
```

We split the date and time components, convert dates to appropriate formats, and create a `zoo` object for aggregation and plotting.

#### Outlier Detection and Handling Missing Values

Detecting and handling outliers and missing values is crucial for accurate analysis.

```r
# Detect outliers in the time series
library(forecast)
myts1 <- tsoutliers(myts)
myts1

# Handle missing values using the 'zoo' package
library(zoo)
myts.Nalocf <- na.locf(myts)
myts.Nalocf

# Clean the time series
myts_clean <- tsclean(myts)
plot(myts_clean)
summary(myts_clean)
```

We use functions to detect outliers and fill missing values to ensure a clean dataset for analysis.

#### Forecasting Models and Accuracy

We split the time series data for training and testing, and then apply different forecasting methods.

```r
set.seed(50)
myts <- ts(rnorm(200), start=1818)
myts_train <- window(myts, start=1818, end=1988)
myts_test <- window(myts, start=1988)

# Apply mean, naive, and drift methods
mean_method <- meanf(myts_train, h=30)
naive_method <- naive(myts_train, h=30)
drift_method <- rwf(myts_train, h=30, drift=T)

# Check accuracy of the methods
accuracy(mean_method, myts_test)
accuracy(naive_method, myts_test)
accuracy(drift_method, myts_test)

# Plot residuals of the mean method
plot(mean_method$residuals)
hist(mean_method$residuals)
shapiro.test(mean_method$residuals)
```

We forecast future values using different methods and evaluate their accuracy against test data.

#### Stationarity and Autocorrelation

Testing for stationarity and analyzing autocorrelation are key steps in time series analysis.

```r
library(tseries)
x <- rnorm(1000)
adf.test(x)

# Non-stationary example
y <- diffinv(x)
adf.test(y)
y1 <- diff(y)
adf.test(y1)

# Autocorrelation analysis
acf(lynx, lag.max=20)
pacf(lynx, lag.max=20)
tsdisplay(lynx, lag.max=20)
```

We perform the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity and plot autocorrelation functions.

#### ARIMA Modeling

ARIMA is a powerful model for time series forecasting.

```r
# Automatic ARIMA model selection
library(forecast)
auto.arima(lynx, trace=T, stepwise=F, approximation=F)

# Manual ARIMA model selection
myarima <- Arima(lynx, order=c(4,0,0))
checkresiduals(myarima)
```

We demonstrate both automatic and manual selection of ARIMA models and validate them using residual checks.
